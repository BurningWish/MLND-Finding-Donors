# Finding Donors
This is the 3nd project for the Machine Learning Nanodegree Program. Using the data collected from 1994 US census, the project aims to build a Machile Learning model to predict where or not a person is a potential donor (earning more than $50k per year).

## Code Usage
- First download the repository to your desktop and unzip it.
- Open the ```report.html``` in your browser, where model development results are showned in a HTML file.
- Alternatively, you can open ```finding_donors.ipynb``` in your Jupyter, to re-run the cells (where necessary data and scripts are also included).
